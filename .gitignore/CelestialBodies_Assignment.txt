Complete the tasks below

You should create a database named universe
Be sure to connect to your database with \c universe. Then, you should add tables named galaxy, star, planet, and moon

Each table should have a primary key
Each primary key should automatically increment
Each table should have a name column

You should use the INT data type for at least two columns that are not a primary or foreign key
You should use the NUMERIC data type at least once
You should use the TEXT data type at least once
You should use the BOOLEAN data type on at least two columns

Each "star" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in galaxy
Each "planet" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in star
Each "moon" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in planet

Your database should have at least five tables -> galaxy, star, planet, moon + another one of my choice
Each table should have at least three rows

The galaxy and star tables should each have at least 6 rows
The planet table should have at least 12 rows
The moon table should have at least 20 rows

Each table should have at least 3 columns

The galaxy, star, planet, and moon tables should each have at least 5 columns

At least 2 columns per table should not accept NULL values
At least 1 column from each table should be required to be UNIQUE
All columns named name should be of type VARCHAR

Each primary key column should follow the naming convention table_name_id. For example, the moon table should have a primary key column named moon_id
Each foreign key column should have the same name as the column it is referencing
